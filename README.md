This documentation is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is used to create documentation pages. Documentation pages are located at `docbook/**/*.mdx`. The [optional catch-all route](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-routes) `pages/[[...docbook]].js` is used to render .mdx files [into static HTML](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export).
